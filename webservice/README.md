===

Based on the "webservice" Rust Book project as found at:
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html>

## Extra Tasks

- [X] Add more documentation to ThreadPool and its public methods.
- [ ] Add signal handling to graceful handle such quit
- [x] Add tests of the libraryâ€™s functionality.
- [ ] Change calls to unwrap to more robust error handling.
- [ ] Use ThreadPool to perform some task other than serving web requests.
- [ ] Find a thread pool crate on crates.io and implement a similar web server using the crate instead. Then compare its API and robustness to the thread pool we implemented.
